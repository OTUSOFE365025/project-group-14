Architectural Concerns

The AIDAP system has to address several architectural concerns to support the main use cases and also meet stakeholder expectations. Since the system relies on AI, multiple user roles and data integration, the system architecture needs to be secure, reliable, accurate and highly performative. Below are the identified architectural concerns. 

1. Ensure that the AI consistently understands and responds accurately to the users queries.

2. Ensure the system is scalable and responds quickly within the required time, even when many users are using it at the same time. 

3. Ensure proper security and access control so that only the authorized users can view or modify protected academic data.

4. Ensure reliable integration with the external university systems including LMS, calendars, student portals and recover well from connection failures without losing data.

5. Ensure high availability and integrated fault tolerance so the system remains online and reliable even if certain components fail.

6. Ensure that user and system data can be securely backed up and restored without any major downtime.

7. Ensure that the system can personalize dashboards and its responses using the stored user interaction history.

8. Ensure consistent functionality and user experience across multiple platforms (web and mobile).

9. Ensure that the system is maintainable and that it can be updated or improved without shutting down the entire system.
