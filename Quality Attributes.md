# Quality Attributes

| Quality Scenario ID | Quality Attributes | Scenario | Associated Use Case |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| QA-1 | Security, Usability, Performance | An unauthorized user attempts to access or publish restricted course material. AIDAP denies access, ensuring that only authorized lecturers can post course material/announcements, and only authorized students can view the material. Authorized lecturers can then monitor analytics such as grades, attendance, engagement, or system usage. Data is displayed accurately in a user-friendly dashboard under normal load. Access is denied to unauthorized users quickly. | UC-1, UC-4 |
| QA-2 | Performance, Reliability, Usability, Security, Availability | A deadline, anomaly, or announcement is sent to students/lecturers, and a student opens their personalized dashboard. The system sends notifications according to user preferences and language, and loads the studentâ€™s dashboard showing only their data. Notifications are delivered quickly and dashboards load fully under normal conditions and are available 99.5% of the time per month. | UC-2 |
| QA-3 | Reliability, Interoperability | During normal operation, the AI platform exchanges information with university systems using APIs. The system synchronizes data accurately across all connected systems. Synchronization is done quickly under normal load. | UC-3 |
| QA-4 | Performance, Usability | A student asks a question using text or voice, the system interprets it using AI and provides an answer based on both live and stored data. Responses are delivered within 2 seconds under normal load, and the system learns from previous interactions. | UC-5 |
| QA-5 | Performance, Security, Availability, Scalability | A system maintainer or administrator requests to view dashboards and performs a backup of data. The system displays performance metrics, latency, and error data quickly, executes backup securely without interrupting service, and maintains performance for all users during peak hours. Dashboards load quickly, backups complete successfully under normal conditions, and the system supports up to 5000 concurrent users while maintaining 99.5% availability. | UC-6 |
