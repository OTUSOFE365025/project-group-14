| Use Case | Description | Associated Requirement ID |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| UC-1: Publish Course Materials, Announcement and View Analytics | The system allows an authenticated lecturer to publish course material or post a course announcement. Lecturers review summarized class analytics such as grades, attendance, engagement, and aggregated statistics. | RL2, RL8, R1, R3, RL1, RL3, RL6 |
| UC-2: Personalized Dashboard and Notifications | A student can view their personalized dashboard on web and mobile to see their upcoming events, grades, and exams. The system sends alerts about deadlines, schedule changes, announcements to students, or anomalies to lecturers. Students can customize notification preferences and language. | R2, RS3, RS9, RS12, RS2, RL4, RL7, RS6 |
| UC-3: Synchronize University Data | The AI platform exchanges information with connected university systems using standard APIs. It ensures data accuracy and consistency across all systems and automatically retries synchronization when a connection fails. | RD1, RD2, RD3, RD4 |
| UC-4: User Authentication and Data Security | The system ensures that only authorized students and lecturers can access course materials, while making sure that user data is safe and privacy regulations are followed. | R8, RS7, RS8, RL8, RA5 |
| UC-5: Access Academic Information | The student can ask an academic question, and the system interprets the text and generates a response using live data and stored knowledge. The model learns from past conversation to improve accuracy and relevance. | RS1, RS10, RS4, RS5, R5, R6 |
| UC-6: System Maintenance and Reliability | System maintainers and administrators monitor analytical dashboards that display system health, latency, and errors. They securely back up configuration and user data and can restore it when needed. The system supports many users accessing the platform at the same time. | RM2, RM6, RA4, RA7 |
