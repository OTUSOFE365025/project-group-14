1. The AIDAP system needs to be built and then deployed in the cloud, so that it can easily scale up in the case of more users joining and be updated without the system shutting down.
2. The AIDAP has to connect to existing university systems such as LMS, registration, calendar, etc, through using standard APIs such as REST or GraphQL, by linking to other platforms, the system can easily pull and synchronize data.
3. Only the authenticated lecturers can publish or update course materials and announcements.
4. Notifications must be sent to the correct recipients according to their preferences and support multiple languages.
5. Students can only view their personalized dashboards, which should reflect real-time data and be responsive on both web and mobile.
6. University data synching should be accurate and consistent it should allow retrying failed attempts while maintaining data integrity. 
7. Only the authorized users can access the system and any student data has to be private, any authentication failures should be logged in the system
8. AI responses to queries need to be generated within 2 seconds on average and learn from any previous interactions to improve accuracy.
9. The dashboards need to aggregate data securely maintain privacy, and also display information that’s relevant to the user’s role.
10. The system's monitoring dashboards should display real-time data, send notifications and their access needs to be restricted to maintainers and administrators. Backups need to be secure and any restore operations need to also maintain data integrity.
11. Any system updates, including AI model versions and API keys, have to be deployed with zero downtime and allow rollback if needed.
12. Administrators have to be able to manage any external system integrations securely, ensuring proper compliance with privacy and institutional security policies.
