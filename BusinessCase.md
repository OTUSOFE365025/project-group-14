Business Case

Universities use multiple platforms to complete basic tasks, which can include online communication, creating and distributing course materials, scheduling classes, and providing academic support to students. From a student perspective, they need to be accessing at least 3-4 separate platforms to access their necessary information, including LMS, student portal, email, and online calendars, which can be very frustrating. Lecturers and administrators also face inconveniences, where lecturers have to put in extra time to repeat announcements or make updates, and administrators have trouble communicating with everyone altogether. It is important to understand that the volume of information processed by a university rapidly increases, and the current approach makes it difficult to manage this information effectively while supporting student success.

To address this inconvenience, a system needed to be developed. The proposed solution is The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP). The AIDAP provides a centralized interface instead of requiring users to check several different apps and programs. The AIDAP will bring together all the key information and services into one simple and easy-to-use system. Users will be able to ask the assistant questions and receive reminders through one conversational interface. By connecting to the different existing university systems mentioned earlier, such as LMS, calendars, email, and portals, the AIDAP will provide personalized responses using AI, it will be able to interpret natural language, answer questions quickly and learn from previous interactions to improve future responses. 

Expected Benefits of AIDAP:
- Students: they will gain immediate access to their personalized schedules, due dates, reminders and announcements, helping them stay organized and improve stress levels. This will help improve overall academic performance and student engagement. 
- Lecturers: they can save time on repetitive administrative tasks, including posting reminders and sharing updates across various platforms, while gaining fast access to their class insights and analytics. 
- Administrators: by using the centralized communication channel, they can simplify things like policy enforcement, university-wide updates, and monitor system usage and trends through the analytical dashboards.
- System Maintainers: the AIDAP has scalable cloud based architecture, which simplifies things like integration, deployment, monitoring and future upgrades, making it easier for system maintainers to do fixes.
